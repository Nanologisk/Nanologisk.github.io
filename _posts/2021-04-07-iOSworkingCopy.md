Connecting iPad to Github using Working Copy and edit Markdown-text with Ulysses.  :octocat:

<!--more-->

The idea comes from [Ulysses and Working Copy][1]. 

### Working Copy
Free access to **Working Copy Pro** (all functionalities) through Github’s free [GitHub Student Developer Pack][2]. The Pack is for both students and educationers at universities.

Clone repositories and get the folders by logging in and authorise the public key that has been generated.

In order to `commit` and `pull`, a full version of `Working Copy` is required, as well as the university’s email-address.

### Ulysses 
Click on the `+` sign besides **library** in order to `Add external folder`. Choose `from files` so `Working Copy` . Find the fight folder and import it to Ulysses. Changes will be automatically transferred to Working Copy.

### Pulling down commits from remote work
Changes can be pulled down through Working Copy

	You Pull down commits from the remote to get the work made by others. As long as all edits are made in different different parts of the project Git knows how to combine the changes. When several people change the same paragraph there is no safe way for a computer to determine how the changes should be combined. You resolve such conflicts by picking the text you want manually.

Be aware of conflicts; they need to be solved  carefully by, for example choose the right version or part of the work, or merging the file.

The work flow goes：Ulysses editing -\> Working Copy committing and pushing: choose the file, `commit changes`, write summary text (this can be omitted by changing the settings) and `commit`changes.
